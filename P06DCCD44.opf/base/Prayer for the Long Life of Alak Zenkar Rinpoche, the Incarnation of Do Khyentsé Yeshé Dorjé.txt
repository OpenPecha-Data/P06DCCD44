Prayer for the Long Life of Alak Zenkar Rinpoche, the Incarnation of Do Khyentsé Yeshé Dorjé
by Kathok Rigdzin Chenpo

om svasti, tsa sum jinlab tenjung lumé tü
Oṃ svasti! Through the blessings of the Three Roots, and the power of the infallible law of
interdependence,
tubten pemö gatsal gyepé nyen
May the secret body, speech and mind of this sun-like incarnation, Thubten Nyima,
choktrul nyima shyönnü sangwa sum
The one who causes the lotus garden of Buddha’s teachings to flourish and blossom,
yongdrub takpé ngowor shyuk soldeb
Remain forever secure within the absolute and unchanging nature, we pray!

According to the requests of Sogyal Rinpoche, emanation of Dorjé Dudjom, who was one of the
five heart-sons of Guru Rinpoche with purest karmic fortune, and Pewar Rinpoche, who is like
a beacon shining out the light of the teachings from a vast treasury of sūtra, mantra and
pith instructions, this was written together with prayers of aspiration, on the first day
of the waxing phase of the moon in the month of Saga Dawa during the Fire Pig year (2007),
by Pema Wangchen Dorjé, the one who holds the name of Kathok Rigdzin Chenpo. May virtue
abound!
